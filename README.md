# next-typescript-tailwind-starter

Mildly opinionated starter.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure is based on an idea from Robin Wieruch ([repo](https://github.com/rwieruch/nextjs-firebase-authentication)) to make your code much more agnostic/easily exportable out of Next.js (just in case).

Despite the extra folders, TypeScript's [path aliases functionality](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#path-mapping) keeps the experience very ergonomic.

## Next.js' Getting Started Instructions

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
